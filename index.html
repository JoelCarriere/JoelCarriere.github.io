            <p>
              As a co-founder of a startup focused on the golf industry, I’ve been leading the development of a mobile and web application tailored to the needs of golfers, coaches, and businesses. My work involves designing algorithms that deliver highly accurate, low-cost data using everyday devices like phones and computers. I’ve also played a key role in shaping business strategies, brand identity, and ensuring that we meet our business targets. Along with my team, I've developed a comprehensive data processing pipeline that offers insights into metrics that matter, improving performance and decision-making. Part of this journey has included conducting data-driven experiments to enhance the machine learning models deployed across both our mobile and web platforms.

              <hr>
              <p>I am a master's student at the University of Guelph, pursuing a Masters of Applied Science with a specialization in AI.
                My research centers on advancing markerless motion capture technology through the power of machine learning.
                I am dedicated to enhancing the accuracy of open-source solutions, with a specific focus on influencing improvements in human ergonomic assessments.
                <br>
                My passion for continuous learning led me to the dynamic field of AI.
                Coming from the comparatively slower pace of the medical device industry, I sought a new, fast-paced domain with limitless possibilities.
                Embracing the fact that <strong><em>I thrive on learning and mastering new skills</em></strong>, I am driven to contribute to the cutting-edge developments in AI.

              <p>Human motion capture is always something that piqued my interest growing up. 
                Thinking about how a subject could stand in place and be replicated, real-time,
                in a virtual environment is so fascinating and a true display of human-machine interaction.
                Following a few years working in biomedical device design and manufacturing, I decided
                to shift focus to the rapidly changing field of artificial intelligence.<br>
                My research is in the field of computer vision applied to human motion capture. 
                Very close to the completion of my AI specialized Masters degree, I am very proud to share
                my research findings.<br>
                Research aside; I enjoy diving into other applications of AI such as using ML 
                to create new music.
