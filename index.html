        <h2>Dedicated to learning.</h2>
        <p>I'm a master's student at the University of Guelph, working towards a Masters of Applied Science with a specialization in AI.
          My main focus on research is utilizing the power of machine learning to improve workplace ergonomics.
          I have always had the interest in learning more which is why I found myself naturally drawn to the field of AI.
          Following a 2 year stint in the medical device industry I felt the need to change my careeer to something with endless possibilities and a fast-paced industry.

        <h2>Motivated by Research.</h2>
        <p>My scholarly research is in the field of computer vision applied to human motion capture. Completing (August 2023) my MASc in Engineering I am proud to show my conference papers, journal articles (pending), and thesis(pending).
          Alongside schoolwork, I also enjoy delving into other applications of AI such as using ML to create new music. Some personal projects can be found on my GitHub.
